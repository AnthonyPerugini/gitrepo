# GitRepo


I created bash/python scripts to automate the process of git/github repo creation.

Usage
----
''' gitrepo [repository_name] '''
repository_name is optional.  Default will be the name of the current working directory.

How It Works
----
* you will need to replace some of the information inside gitrepo.py
	* you can either hard_code in your username and password, or keep it as is (prompts for input)
	* TODO: finish setup

Requirements:
----
	* Selenium (https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
	* Chrome (or browser of choice) (https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)
	* chromedriver (or driver of choice) (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
